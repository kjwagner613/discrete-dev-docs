    <section>
      <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Discrete Development LLC designs and implements systems that stay aligned with how work gets done. We serve
          small
          and medium-sized businesses that need clarity, adaptability, and long-term stability in their operational
          tools.
          Our approach emphasizes observation before action, intentional simplicity, and solutions that evolve naturally
          with the organizations they support. By combining the Microsoft ecosystem with custom development, we deliver
          systems that reduce drift, improve workflow reliability, and support sustainable growth.</p>
      </div>
      <h3>Founding Principle</h3>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Discrete Development exists to build systems—and a business—that operate in balance. Work should support
          people,
          not extract from them. Our goal is not to maximize profit at any cost, but to create sustainable value through
          clarity, respect, and honest alignment with how work gets done. We choose long‑term relationships over
          short‑term
          gain, contribution over competition, and integrity over scale. Success is measured by stability, usefulness,
          and
          the well being of the people we serve and the people we work with.</p>
      </div>
      <h3>Mission</h3>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>To design systems that remain aligned with real‑world work, supporting clarity, adaptability, and long‑term
          usefulness.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Vision</h3>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>A future where business systems evolve naturally with the organizations they support, eliminating drift and
          restoring clarity to everyday work.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>
          Across more than 30 years of experience, one pattern stands out: systems are rarely designed around how work
          is
          done. They reflect how work used to be done, or how someone wished it would be done. Today, processes evolve
          continuously—“finished” is elusive. The best systems are those that stay aligned with reality.</p>
        <p>By examining a company’s history and core processes, patterns emerge that reveal opportunities for periodic
          drift alignment. We design systems with adjustment characteristics built in, allowing them to evolve naturally
          as work evolves.</p>
        <p>To reach the desired future state, we must first understand the present state with precision. Our purpose is
          to
          implement solutions that meet today’s requirements while remaining adaptable to tomorrow’s change. By
          grounding
          design in purpose and learning from history, we deliver systems built for long‑term use, not short‑term
          compliance.</p>
      </div>
      <h2>Core Values & Philosophy</h2>
      <h3>Philosophy Statement</h3>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>We design systems that respect how work is done and the people who do it. Our approach begins with
          understanding before action, ensuring solutions are robust, humane, and aligned. We refuse to impose templates
          that distort reality; instead, we build precisely what is needed so clients are never handed a handicap.</p>
      </div>
      <h3>Clarity</h3>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>We maintain clarity of purpose by holding a clear mental image of the desired outcome and continuously
          evaluating whether our efforts move us closer to it. Complexity is tempting but often misleading; when work
          becomes overly
          complex, we pause, reassess, and realign.</p>
      </div>
      <h3>Integrity</h3>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Integrity is alignment. What we say, document, and deliver remains consistent across environments and
          circumstances. Strong foundations endure, and every interaction contributes to that foundation.</p>
      </div>
      <h3>Continuous Growth</h3>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>We learn continuously—individually and within the systems we build. Each iteration reveals new insight. We
          adopt new methods when they serve the purpose, guided by curiosity and disciplined experimentation.</p>
      </div>
      <h3>Empathy</h3>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>We listen first. Trust is built through patience, understanding, and shared perspective.</p>
      </div>
      <h3>Respect</h3>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>We value diverse viewpoints and respond thoughtfully rather than react impulsively.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <h2>Guiding Principles</h2>
    <h3>Purpose Above All</h3>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>Every solution begins with real needs. Systems are vessels that sustain and expand those solutions. When a
        system
        proves reliable, it naturally grows to replace failing systems around it.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Respect for Original Intent</h3>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>We begin by understanding the original intent of a system before extending it. Expansion is approached
        thoughtfully, balancing new requirements with existing design boundaries.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Our Nature, Not a Goal</h3>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>Our values are not aspirations—they define how we operate today.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Client‑Centered Understanding</h3>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>We begin each engagement without assumptions or constraints, ensuring solutions reflect real needs rather than
        imposed structures.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>We design systems that support users without imposing unnecessary structure, allowing tools to integrate
        naturally into existing workflows. Emphasis is placed on modularity, documentation, and clear interfaces so
        solutions can evolve without breaking as conditions change.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Competitive Landscape</h3>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>Our competitors include MSPs, template‑driven Power Platform consultants, and custom development firms. While
        we
        share a market category, we are not in the same business. MSPs often prioritize volume over depth, and
        template‑based consultants impose rigid structures that fail to reflect real workflows. Custom dev shops may
        deliver powerful systems but lack ongoing alignment and operational fidelity.</p>
      <p>Discrete Development operates from a different foundation. Performance is not our inspiration—it is the natural
        result of returning to purpose, honoring original intent, and building only what is needed. Our methodology
        emphasizes clarity, restraint, and a lean embodiment of the client’s true workflow. By aligning systems with how
        work gets done, we achieve reliability and long‑term stability without excess, drift, or unnecessary complexity.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2>Services & Value Propositions</h2>
    <h3>What Makes Us Different</h3>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>Our difference lies not only in what we build, but in how and why we build it. We do not simply deliver
        software;
        we
        deliver understanding, respect, and partnership. Our systems evolve alongside our clients, supporting their
        unique
        journeys and empowering their people. This approach forms the foundation of long-term trust.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>How We Select the Right Solution Elements</h3>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>Adopting a templated technology also means inheriting its limitations. While platforms can provide value when
        they
        align closely with a client’s goals, we never assume suitability. We evaluate whether a platform supports
        efficient
        execution and reliably enables the client’s vision. The goal is always dependable outcomes; everything else is
        negotiable.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Core Offerings</h3>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>We modernize and organize business processes using SharePoint, Dataverse, Power Apps, and Power Automate to
        create
        custom management tools tailored to real workflows.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Workflow Architecture</h3>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>We design lean workflows that meet operational requirements and support audit readiness where needed.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>React / JSX Development</h3>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>When platform constraints conflict with methodology, we build custom systems using modern architecture. These
        systems are designed for adaptability from the outset and remain aligned over time through periodic drift
        assessments. Our solutions feel like an extension of the client’s workspace because they are built around how
        work
        is done.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Go‑to‑Market Strategy</h3>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>We grow through reputation, referrals, and targeted visibility within professional networks. Our outreach
        emphasizes
        clarity of purpose, respect for client intent, and demonstration of real outcomes. Engagements begin with
        observation‑first discovery, ensuring alignment before commitment. We maintain a disciplined pipeline: one
        primary
        active client, one qualified opportunity “on deck,” and selective intake to preserve quality and focus.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Market & Positioning</h2>
    <h3>Who We Serve</h3>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>We primarily serve small to medium-sized businesses across diverse industries that seek tailored, scalable
        technology solutions. Our clients value personalized service, flexibility, and systems that grow with their
        evolving
        operational needs. These organizations often face challenges with off-the-shelf software that fails to
        accommodate
        their unique workflows or business models.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>What Problems We Solve</h3>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>We address critical pain points such as inefficient workflows, lack of system adaptability, poor user adoption
        due
        to rigid templates, and difficulties in maintaining alignment between business processes and technology
        solutions.
        Our approach eliminates common frustrations by delivering custom-built systems that reflect real-world
        operations
        and evolve alongside our clients.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Why Our Approach Fits Small/Medium Businesses</h3>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>Small and medium enterprises require solutions that are both cost-effective and highly adaptable. Unlike
        large-scale
        enterprise software that can be overly complex and rigid, our methodology emphasizes agility, customization, and
        close client collaboration. This ensures rapid deployment, minimal disruption, and ongoing alignment with
        business
        goals, making us an ideal partner for growing businesses.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Where We Sit in the Ecosystem</h3>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>We position ourselves as trusted technology partners who bridge the gap between generic software providers and
        bespoke development firms. Leveraging the Microsoft ecosystem alongside modern development frameworks, we offer
        a
        hybrid approach that combines the reliability of established platforms with the flexibility of custom code. This
        unique positioning allows us to deliver solutions that are both robust and tailored, meeting the nuanced demands
        of
        our clients.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Intellectual Property & Trademark Strategy</h3>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>Discrete Development is actively securing formal trademark protection for its core brand assets to establish a
        defensible, long‑term market identity. This includes the company name, logo, visual identity system, and the
        guiding
        tagline “Work from the fringe, deliver clarity at the center.” These elements represent the strategic philosophy
        and
        operational approach that differentiate the company within the consulting and systems‑architecture space.</p>
    </div>
    <h4>Scope of Protection</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Word mark: Discrete Development</li>
      <li>Design mark: company logo and associated iconography</li>
      <li>Tagline: “Work from the fringe, deliver clarity at the center.”</li>
      <li>Brand identity elements: color system, typography, and signature visual language</li>
      <li>Service categories: consulting, workflow architecture, systems design, and related offerings</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Strategic Rationale</h4>
    <p>Trademark protection strengthens the company’s competitive position by:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensuring clear differentiation in a crowded professional‑services market</li>
      <li>Protecting the unique philosophy and methodologies that define the brand</li>
      <li>Preventing misuse or imitation of the company’s name, visuals, or messaging</li>
      <li>Supporting long‑term brand equity as the business scales</li>
      <li>Enhancing credibility with clients, partners, and future investors</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Status & Timeline</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Comprehensive trademark search completed</li>
      <li>USPTO filing in progress for both word and design marks</li>
      <li>Expected registration timeline: 8–12 months</li>
      <li>™ symbol in use during the application period</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Future IP Development</h4>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>As Discrete Development expands, additional intellectual property protections may be pursued for proprietary
        frameworks, methodologies, templates, and potential software tools. This includes emerging branded concepts such
        as:</p>
      <p class="indent">Impala Logic and other systems that support the company’s clarity‑first approach.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Operating Model</h2>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>Our operating model prioritizes quality, alignment, and long‑term stability. We grow deliberately, often
        focusing
        on
        one client at a time to ensure consistent attention, accountability, and fidelity to original intent.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Client Engagement</h3>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>Each engagement begins with a value proposition that outlines alignment between client needs, methodology, and
        outcomes. This establishes a shared understanding before any technical work begins.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Technical Support Structure</h3>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>Discrete Development maintains a modular support model that includes a remote technical specialist (contract
        basis) for overflow development, troubleshooting, and rapid prototyping. This structure keeps fixed costs low
        while
        enabling flexible capacity during early growth. As the business scales, this role transitions into a formalized
        contractor pool or an in‑house technical hire.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Internal Tools</h3>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>Internal operations run on Microsoft 365 Business tools, with QuickBooks Online supporting finance and
        accounting.
        These platforms provide reliability, clarity, and predictable workflows.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Project Execution</h3>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>Projects are delivered using either Microsoft platforms or custom codebases built with React, Node.js, JSX, and
        Express, depending on requirements and long‑term maintainability.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Project Life Cycle</h3>

    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>Intake → Assessment → Build → Deliver → Support</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Design Review & Feedback</h3>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>Documented designs are reviewed and approved before development begins. Continuous feedback ensures alignment
        throughout the project life cycle and prevents drift.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Project Management</h3>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>PMI principles guide planning, while Agile practices support execution, adaptability, and iterative refinement.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="isolate">
      <h3>Delivery Transparency & Reliability</h3>
      <p>Discrete Development does not rely on rigid, punitive SLAs. Instead, we operate on a model of transparent
        progress, reliable commitments, and early risk visibility.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Communication over countdowns</li>
        <li>Reliability over rigidity</li>
        <li>Visibility over surprises</li>
        <li>Quality over speed</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When we give a timeline, it’s because we can stand behind it — not because a policy demands it. I realize we
        are
        shifting from contemporary methodology, that is intentional. Disrupting the system to restore thoughtful
        consideration over
        simple bandwidth optimization.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Engagement Types</h2>
    <h3>Project-Based</h3>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>Any initiative contracted from our published catalog of services.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Fractional</h3>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>A scoped portion of a project delivered as a discrete work package.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Advisory</h3>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>A site survey and assessment to identify deviations between process and system alignment, with recommendations
        for
        correction or realignment. Advisory work may include opportunities to implement targeted system adjustments
        based
        on
        current needs and historic patterns of drift.</p>
      <p>Pricing Approach</p>
      <p class="indent">I. Transparent, predictable structure</p>
      <p class="indent">II. Value-aligned pricing</p>
      <p class="indent">III. Project components (tech stack, environment, scope) determine cost</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Project-Based Pricing Example</h3>
    <h4>Project: Sales & Service Operations System</h4>
    <div class="paragraph">     
      <p>A lean implementation using Microsoft 365 Business Premium components to support the full lifecycle of a
        sales-order or service-driven operation. This includes core elements of Sales, Production Planning, Service
        Ticketing, Customer
        Service, Workflow Administration, Human Resources, and Finance.</p>
      <p>Price: $25,000</p>
      <p>The client receives a custom system built to their specific workflows, including interfaces, automation where
        appropriate,
        and support for forecasting, procurement timing, consumables tracking, technician time, shipping prompting, and
        invoice
        content generation.</p>
      <p>The solution is subscription-free with no recurring costs.</p>
      <p>This model adapts well to any business that builds products or delivers services requiring stock forecasting,
        procurement
        lead-time management, and reliable fulfillment within promised delivery schedules.</p>
    </div>
      <h4>Financial Projection</h4>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Assuming an average project value of $25,000 to $50,000 and a target of two projects per quarter, Discrete
          Development
          anticipates generating $200,000 to $400,000 in project revenue annually. With a disciplined focus on one active
          client at a time and a pipeline that maintains one qualified opportunity “on deck,” the company can ensure
          consistent delivery quality and client satisfaction while scaling revenue in alignment with capacity.</p>
      <p>Discrete Development anticipates two primary anchor projects per quarter, supported by mid-sized engagements
        and
        fractional or advisory work. Revenue scales with demand and team composition, maintaining a lean cost structure
        and
        positive cash flow through milestone-based billing. Growth is measured, sustainable, and aligned with delivery
        quality
        rather than volume.

      <p>Clear positioning, practical examples, and demonstrated outcomes that show how simple, well-considered designs
        often
        prove more robust and adaptable than complex implementations.</p>
        </div>
      <h3>Delivery Continuity & Resource Flexibility</h3>
      <div class="paragraph">
      <p><em>Risk</em></p>
      <p>Fluctuating project demand requires scalable expertise without compromising quality or consistency.</p>
      <p><em>Mitigation</em></p>
      <p>A dynamic project team model that scales based on demand, supported by standardized delivery frameworks,
        documentation-first design practices, and a trusted network of collaborators engaged as required.</p></div>

      <p>As demand increases, Discrete Development expands capacity through its dynamic project team model, adding
        capability
        as required while maintaining consistency through standardized delivery frameworks and documentation-first
        practices.</p>
      <p>As demand fluctuates, capacity is adjusted intentionally to reflect market conditions, ensuring sustainability,
        delivery
        quality, and operational resilience across varying economic environments.</p></div>
      <h2>Brand & Operating Philosophy</h2>
      <div class="paragraph">
      <p>Discrete Development is founded on the belief that effective systems must reflect how work is actually
        performed,
        not how
        it is assumed to occur.</p>
      <p>Processes evolve, constraints shift, and edge cases often reveal more than standard scenarios. Discrete
      Development designs software and operational systems that acknowledge this reality, prioritizing clarity, adaptability, and
      long-term usefulness over rigid abstraction or excessive complexity.</p></div>
      <h3>Design Philosophy</h3>
      <div class="paragraph">
      <p>The firm believes that sophistication is best expressed through restraint. Systems are designed to support
        users without imposing unnecessary structure, allowing tools to integrate naturally into existing workflows. Emphasis is
        placed on modularity, documentation, and clear interfaces so solutions can evolve without breaking as conditions change.
      </p></div>
      <h3>Operating Approach</h3>
      <div class="paragraph">
      <p>Work begins with observation and understanding before design or implementation. Discrete Development engages
        deeply
        with a limited number of clients at any given time to ensure focus, accountability, and outcome ownership.
        Solutions are treated as long-term assets rather than short-term fixes. Each engagement aims to leave behind
        infrastructure that retains value, supports future growth, and reduces reliance on ad hoc workarounds.</p></div>
      <h3>Engagement Discipline</h3>
      <div class="paragraph">
      <p>The firm intentionally limits concurrent primary engagements to preserve delivery quality and alignment.
        Additional scoped
        or advisory work may be accepted when appropriate, but not at the expense of focus or execution standards.
        This disciplined engagement model protects both the client’s investment and the integrity of the work.</p></div>
      <h3>Client Expectations</h3>
      <div class="paragraph">
      <p>Clients can expect direct communication, transparent decision-making, and systems designed around their
        specific
        environment rather than generalized templates. Discrete Development takes responsibility for outcomes, not just
        deliverables, and prioritizes clarity in architecture, trade offs, and long-term implications.</p></div>
      <h3>Values & Boundaries</h3>
      <div class="paragraph">
      <p>Discrete Development does not pursue one-size-fits-all solutions, half-measures, or volume-driven growth. Work
        is
        accepted selectively, with an emphasis on sustainability, quality, and alignment over speed or scale.
        This philosophy reflects experience gained through years of hands-on problem solving in complex, real-world
        environments and serves as a guiding framework for all strategic and operational decisions.</p></div>
      <h3>Communication Principles</h3>
      <div class="paragraph">
      <p>Discrete Development communicates with the same clarity and restraint that guides its system design.</p>
      <p>Language is direct and literal. Abstraction is avoided where clarity will suffice. Structure and organization
        are
        used to
        convey meaning rather than emphasis or ornamentation.</p>
      <p>Visual identity, written materials, and client communications prioritize simplicity, consistency, and
        readability. Design Visual identity, written materials, and client communications prioritize simplicity, consistency, and
        readability. Design choices favor negative space, limited color palettes, and understated typography to reflect the firm’s focus on
        clarity and function over decoration. Across all channels, communication is intended to be transparent, calm, and precise, reinforcing trust and
        reducing friction throughout the engagement life cycle.</p>
        </div>
      <h2>Highlights</h2>

      <p>Operating Costs at Target Operating Level</p>    
      <div class="paragraph">
      <p>As the business matures into a stable delivery rhythm, Discrete Development anticipates the following monthly
        operating
        costs. These reflect the addition of salaried positions for a Project Manager and DevOps Lead by Year 5, roles
        that are
        currently contracted, along with dynamic developer capacity as needed.</p></div>
      <p>Projected Monthly Operating Costs</p></div>

      <ul>
        <li>Software and tools: $500</li>
        <li>Insurance: approximately $3,333</li>
        <li>Payroll: $25,000</li>
        <li>Marketing: $3,000</li>
        <li>Travel: $2,000</li>
        <li>Miscellaneous: $5,000</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Total estimated monthly operating cost: approximately $38,833</p>
      <div class="paragraph">
      <p>Payroll reaches this level only at full target operating maturity (Year 5), reflecting two salaried leadership
        roles and partial
        developer capacity; Years 1–3 rely primarily on contract labor.</p>
      <p>This cost structure supports a small, high-skill technical team capable of delivering ERP-level architecture
        and
        ongoing
        client support.</p></div>
      <img id="img1" src="images/bp1.png" alt="Operating Costs Chart" />
      <h3>Revenue Model</h3>
      <div class="paragraph">
      <p>Discrete Development operates on a hybrid consulting and product development model, generating revenue through
        project delivery, ongoing support, and long-term architectural evolution.</p></div>
      <h3>Project revenue</h3>
      <div class="paragraph">
      <p class="indent">Average project value: $25,000 to $50,000</p>

      <p>Expected project volume: Two projects per quarter, with limited scoped engagements between.
      Workload target: Two active projects at any given time</p></div>
      <h3>Recurring revenue</h3>
      <div class="paragraph">
      <p>Priority Support is offered at ten percent of the original project cost. This includes immediate phone support
        when
        available and next day onsite support when appropriate.</p>
      <p>Assuming twenty-five percent of project clients convert after the first year, reflecting systems that require
        periodic
        adjustment and clients who value continuity, recurring revenue is projected at approximately two thousand
        dollars
        per
        month.</p></div>
      <h3>Target Operating Level</h3>
      <div class="paragraph">
      <p>The Target Operating Level represents a stable, predictable operating state in which the company maintains
        consistent
        revenue, controlled workload, and strong margins while advancing the long-term product roadmap.</p></div>
      <p>Target Operating Level Metrics</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Monthly revenue: $50,000</li>
        <li>Client volume: two new clients per month</li>
        <li>Active workload: two concurrent projects</li>
        <li>Margin target: thirty to forty percent operating margin</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Margins trend toward the upper end of the range during periods of high utilization and toward the lower end
        during
        capacity-building or transitional periods.</p></div>

      <h2>Objectives</h2>
      <div class="paragraph">
      <p>Discrete Development’s growth trajectory is based on architectural maturity, operational stability, and the
        evolution of “The
        Software” into a standalone ERP-class product. This trajectory is intentionally milestone-driven rather than
        date-driven,
        allowing validation and revenue to dictate pace. Growth is measured not in headcounts or locations, but in
        integrated
        capability, leverage, and product evolution.</p>

      <h2>Margin Strategy</h2>
      <div class="paragraph">
      <p>Discrete Development targets a thirty to forty percent operating margin. This is achieved through high value
        project
        engagements, low-fixed overhead, architectural leverage, efficient delivery workflows, and selective hiring of
        high-impact
        roles. This margin level supports sustainable growth, ongoing product development, and long-term financial
        stability.</p></div>
      <h2>Financial Assumptions</h2>
      <div class="paragraph">
      <p>Discrete Development operates with a lean cost structure designed to remain flexible, predictable, and aligned
        with
        actual demand. The following assumptions underpin the financial model and reflect deliberate constraints rather
        than
        maximum growth scenarios.</p></div>
      <h3>Operating Costs</h3>
      <div class="paragraph">
      <p>Overhead is intentionally limited and primarily consists of essential business tools and services, including
        productivity and collaboration software licenses, paid training for recurring project collaborators, and
        targeted
        marketing efforts.
        Marketing spend is planned conservatively, with an initial target budget of approximately three thousand dollars
        per month,
        adjusted based on demand and effectiveness. Operating costs are expected to reach the target level of
        approximately $38,800
        per month as the team structure matures beginning in Year 5.</p>
