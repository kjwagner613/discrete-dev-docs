    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
    <p>Discrete Development LLC designs and implements systems that stay aligned with how work gets done. We serve small 
and medium-sized businesses that need clarity, adaptability, and long-term stability in their operational tools. Our 
approach emphasizes observation before action, intentional simplicity, and solutions that evolve naturally with the 
organizations they support. By combining the Microsoft ecosystem with custom development, we deliver systems that 
reduce drift, improve workflow reliability, and support sustainable growth.
<h2>Highlights</h2>
<h3>Operating Costs at Target Operating Level</h3>
<p>As the business matures into a stable delivery rhythm, Discrete Development anticipates the following monthly operating 
costs. These reflect the addition of salaried positions for a Project Manager and DevOps Lead by Year 5, roles that are 
currently contracted, along with dynamic developer capacity as needed.</p>
<h3>Projected Monthly Operating Costs</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Software and tools: $500</li>
  <li>Insurance: approximately $3,333</li>
  <li>Payroll: $25,000</li>
  <li>Marketing: $3,000</li>
  <li>Travel: $2,000</li>
  <li>Miscellaneous: $5,000</li>
</ul>
<p>Total estimated monthly operating cost: approximately $38,833</p>
<p>Payroll reaches this level only at full target operating maturity (Year 5), reflecting two salaried leadership roles and partial 
developer capacity; Years 1–3 rely primarily on contract labor.</p>
<p>This cost structure supports a small, high-skill technical team capable of delivering ERP-level architecture and ongoing 
client support.</p>

<h2>Revenue Model</h2>
<p>Discrete Development operates on a hybrid consulting and product development model, generating revenue through 
project delivery, ongoing support, and long-term architectural evolution.</p>
<h3><em>Project revenue</em></h3>
<p>Average project value: $25,000 to $50,000</p>
<p>Expected project volume: Two projects per month</p>
<p>Workload target: Two active projects at any given time</p>
<h3><em>Recurring revenue</em></h3>
<p>Priority Support is offered at ten percent of the original project cost. This includes immediate phone support when 
available and next day onsite support when appropriate.</p>
<p>Assuming twenty-five percent of project clients convert after the first year, reflecting systems that require periodic 
adjustment and clients who value continuity, recurring revenue is projected at approximately two thousand dollars per 
month.</p>
<h2>Target Operating Level</h2>
<p>The Target Operating Level represents a stable, predictable operating state in which the company maintains consistent 
revenue, controlled workload, and strong margins while advancing the long-term product roadmap.</p> 
<h3>Target Operating Level Metrics</h3>
<p>Monthly revenue: $50,000</p>
<p>Client volume: two new clients per month</p>
<p>Active workload: two concurrent projects</p>
<p>Margin target: thirty to forty percent operating margin</p>
<p>Margins trend toward the upper end of the range during periods of high utilization and toward the lower end during </p>
capacity-building or transitional periods.</p>
<img id="img2" src="images/bp2.png" alt="Revenue and Margin Chart" />

<h2>Margin Strategy</h2>
<p>Discrete Development targets a thirty to forty percent operating margin. This is achieved through high value project 
engagements, low-fixed overhead, architectural leverage, efficient delivery workflows, and selective hiring of high-impact 
roles. This margin level supports sustainable growth, ongoing product development, and long-term financial stability.</p>
<h2>Mission, Vision, Purpose</h2>
<h3>Founding principle</h3>
<p>Discrete Development exists to build systems—and a business—that operate in balance. Work should support people, not
diminish them.</p>
<h3>Mission</h3>
<p>To design systems that remain aligned with real-world work, supporting clarity, adaptability, and long-term usefulness.</p>
<h3>Vision</h3>
<p>A future where business systems evolve naturally with the organizations they support, eliminating drift and restoring clarity
to everyday work.</p>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>Systems must reflect how work is performed. We design solutions that evolve naturally as work evolves, grounded in 
purpose and informed by history.</p>
<h2>Core Values and Philosophy</h2>
<h3>Philosophy statement</h3>
<p>We design systems that respect how work is done, and the people who do it. Our approach begins with understanding 
before action, ensuring solutions are robust, humane, and aligned. We refuse to impose templates that distort reality; 
instead, we build precisely what is needed, so clients are never handicapped by software.</p>
<h3>Clarity</h3>
<p>We maintain clarity of purpose by holding a clear mental image of the desired outcome and continuously evaluating 
whether our efforts move us closer to it. Complexity is tempting but often misleading; when work becomes overly complex,
we pause, reassess, and realign.</p>
<h3>Integrity</h3>
<p>Integrity is alignment. What we say, document, and deliver remains consistent across environments and circumstances. 
Strong foundations endure, and every interaction contributes to that foundation.</p>
<h3>Simplicity</h3>
<p>We pursue simplicity not as an aesthetic, but as a practical discipline. Simple systems are easier to understand, maintain, 
and evolve. We strip away unnecessary layers until only what is essential remains.</p>
<h3>Continuous growth</h3>
<p>We learn continuously—individually and within the systems we build. Each iteration reveals new insight. We adopt new 
methods when they serve the purpose, guided by curiosity and disciplined experimentation.</p>
<h3>Empathy</h3>
<p>We listen first. Trust is built through patience, understanding, and shared perspective.</p> 
<h3>Respect</h3>
<p>We welcome diverse viewpoints and consider alternate perspectives to ensure systems are designed thoughtfully and 
serve all users effectively.</p>
<p>Discrete Development, LLC Business Plan PAGE 7 OF 11</p>
<h2>Guiding Principles</h2>
<h3>Purpose Above All</h3>
<p>Every solution begins with real needs. Systems are vessels that sustain and expand those solutions. When a system 
proves reliable, it naturally grows to replace failing systems around it.</p>
<h3>Respect for Original Intent</h3>
<p>We begin by understanding the original intent of a system before extending it. Expansion is approached thoughtfully, 
balancing new requirements with existing design boundaries.</p> 
<h3>Our Nature, Not a Goal</h3>
<p>Our values are not aspirations—they define how we operate today.</p>
<h3>Client-Centered Understanding</h3>
<p>We begin each engagement without assumptions or constraints, ensuring solutions reflect real needs rather than imposed
structures.</p>
<h2>Services and Value Proposition</h2>
<h3>What Makes Us Different</h3>
<p>Our difference lies not only in what we build, but in how and why we build it. We do not simply deliver software; we deliver 
understanding, respect, and partnership. Our systems evolve alongside our clients, supporting their unique journeys and 
empowering their people. This approach forms the foundation of long-term trust.</p>
<h3>How We Select the Right Solution Elements</h3>
<p>Adopting a templated technology also means inheriting its limitations. While platforms can provide value when they align 
closely with a client’s goals, we never assume suitability. We evaluate whether a platform supports efficient execution and
reliably enables the client’s vision. The goal is always dependable outcomes; everything else is negotiable.</p>
<h3>Core Offerings</h3>
<h4>Microsoft Ecosystem</h4>
<p>We modernize and organize business processes using SharePoint, Dataverse, Power Apps, and Power Automate to 
create custom management tools tailored to real workflows.</p>
<h4>Workflow Architecture</h4>
<p>We design lean workflows that meet operational requirements and support audit readiness where needed.</p>
<h4>React / JSX Development</h4>
<p>When platform constraints conflict with methodology, we build custom systems using modern architecture. These systems
are designed for adaptability from the outset and remain aligned over time through periodic drift assessments. Our 
solutions feel like an extension of the client’s workspace because they are built around how work is done.</p>
<h2>Go-to-Market Strategy</h2>
<p>We grow through reputation, referrals, and targeted visibility within professional networks. Our outreach emphasizes 
clarity of purpose, respect for client intent, and demonstration of real outcomes. Engagements begin with observation-first 
discovery, ensuring alignment before commitment. We maintain a disciplined pipeline: one primary active client, one 
qualified opportunity “on deck,” and selective intake to preserve quality and focus. </p>

<h2>Market & Positioning</h2>
<h3>Who We Serve</h3>
<p>We primarily serve small to medium sized businesses across diverse industries that seek tailored, scalable technology 
solutions. Our clients value personalized service, flexibility, and systems that grow with their evolving operational needs. 
These organizations often face challenges with off-the-shelf software that fails to accommodate their unique workflows or 
business models.</p>
<h3>What Problems We Solve</h3>   
<p>We address critical pain points such as inefficient workflows, lack of system adaptability, poor user adoption due to rigid 
templates, and difficulties in maintaining alignment between business processes and technology solutions. Our approach 
eliminates common frustrations by delivering custom-built systems that reflect real-world operations and evolve alongside 
our clients.</p>
<h3>Why Our Approach Fits Small/Medium Businesses</h3>
<p>Small and medium enterprises require solutions that are both cost-effective and highly adaptable. Unlike large-scale 
enterprise software that can be overly complex and rigid, our methodology emphasizes agility, customization, and close 
client collaboration. This ensures rapid deployment, minimal disruption, and ongoing alignment with business goals, 
making us an ideal partner for growing businesses.</p>
<h3> We Sit in the Ecosystem</h3>
<p>We position ourselves as trusted technology partners who bridge the gap between generic software providers and 
bespoke development firms. Leveraging the Microsoft ecosystem alongside modern development frameworks, we offer a 
hybrid approach that combines the reliability of established platforms with the flexibility of custom code. This unique 
positioning allows us to deliver solutions that are both robust and tailored, meeting the nuanced demands of our clients.</p>
<h3>Operating Model</h3>
<p>Our operating model prioritizes quality, alignment, and long-term stability. We grow deliberately, often focusing on one 
client at a time to ensure consistent attention, accountability, and fidelity to original intent.</p>
<h3>Client Engagement</h3>
<p>Each engagement begins with a value proposition that outlines alignment between client needs, methodology, and 
outcomes. This establishes a shared understanding before any technical work begins.</p>
<h3>Technical Support Structure</h3>
<p></p>Discrete Development maintains a modular support model that includes a remote technical specialist (contract basis) for 
overflow development, troubleshooting, and rapid prototyping. This structure keeps fixed costs low while enabling flexible 
capacity during early growth. As the business scales, this role transitions into a formalized contractor pool or an in-house 
technical hire.</p>
<h3>Internal Tools</h3>
<p>Internal operations run on Microsoft 365 Business tools, with QuickBooks Online supporting finance and accounting. 
These platforms provide reliability, clarity, and predictable workflows.</p>
<h3>Project Execution</h3>
<p>Projects are delivered using either Microsoft platforms or custom codebases built with React, Node.js, JSX, and Express, 
depending on requirements and long-term maintainability.</p>
<h3>Project Lifecycle</h3>
<p>Intake → Assessment → Build → Deliver → Support</p>
<h3>Design Review & Feedback</h3>
<p>Documented designs are reviewed and approved before development begins. Continuous feedback ensures alignment 
throughout the project lifecycle and prevents drift.</p>
<h3>Project Management</h3>
<p>PMI principles guide planning, while Agile practices support execution, adaptability, and iterative refinement.</p>
<h2>Growth Plan</h2>
<h3>Growth Philosophy</h3>
<p>Discrete Development prioritizes measured, sustainable growth over rapid expansion. The focus is on depth of 
engagement, quality of delivery, and reputation earned through execution rather than volume.</p>
<h3>Near-term Growth Strategy</h3>
<h4>Visibility & Positioning</h4>
<p>Establish a clear and consistent presence that communicates who we are, what we do, and how we work. Growth begins 
with being discoverable and understandable to the right audience.</p>
<h4>Focused Client Engagement</h4>
<p>Maintain primary focus on one active client engagement at a time, ensuring full attention, quality, and outcome ownership.</p>
<h4>Pipeline Continuity</h4>
<p>While actively engaged, maintain one additional qualified client opportunity “on deck” to ensure continuity without over-extension.</p>
<h4>Growth Controls</h4>
<h5>Intentional Intake</h5>
<p>New work is accepted selectively to preserve delivery quality and alignment with Discrete Development’s methodology.</p>
<h5>Reputation Led Expansion</h5>
<p>Growth is driven through referrals, demonstrated outcomes, and repeat engagements rather than aggressive sales or 
broad outreach.</p>
<h5>Long-Term Outlook</h5>
<p>As demand increases, Discrete Development expands capacity through its dynamic project team model, adding 
capability as required while maintaining consistency through standardized delivery frameworks and documentation first 
practices.</p>
